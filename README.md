IMAD ASSIGNMENT ESSAY
QUESTION 6:

We were instructed to develop an app whereby the user inputs a certain age and different famous people for different eras appear. There are different fun facts about these famous people. There are numerous aspects at we had to consider while developing the app. These are the following aspects that we had to consider. 
1.	Text view – This serves as a textbox for the user to see the fun facts           presented in this box. The use of this is to allow the user to read the facts and learn something that they didn’t know. 

2.	Edit Text – This is where the user can input their own age or anyone else for that matter. This is a vital component in my time developing this app. This helps us recognise what age the user is inputting and to also check if the age is valid or not. This component severs as a bridge to the user and the fun facts that await them. By using this component my code can recognise the age that the user is inputting and give the fun facts once entered correctly. This also goes hand in hand with the two buttons at the bottom of the screen. 


3.	Buttons – There are two buttons on the bottom of the screen which helps the user search and clear if he/she makes an error. The search button is used so that the user and press this button and the information can pop up on the screen with ease. This makes my app so much more convenient for the users to use. It also makes it easier for elder people to use since they have less knowledge about technology in today’s world. I also used a clear button so if the user inputs a wrong number into my app, they can easily clear and enter another number if they choose to do so. This can also be used if the user inputs an invalid number into my app. If that is the case, then a message will appear on the screen telling the user to input a valid number into the app. I coded my app to only take digits. So, if the user inputs the spelt-out number or uses a comma the code will pick an invalid number being inputted and will put display the error message above and not give any fun facts that I have coded for. 

4.	Text view- I used another text view to serve as a label of kinds to let the users know that this is an app that is used for learning fun facts about their ages and about history. This also brightens up the app and makes is more attractive to new users who are willing to use my app and makes it more eye catching to the users. This also makes my app look more professional to the users. I also decided to change the colour of the text and the font size so it can catch more user’s attention easier. I used the colour blue because it complements my app’s design, and it is easier for most users who wear glasses to see. Blue is one of the most liked colours in the world. This is because most people associate blue with calm things like the sea and the sky. Whereas if I used red then a lot of people associate that with violent and disruptive things.

THEME:

The theme of my app is based of the acting industry. The fun facts that get displayed is about the actor and his/he names so that the user can identify them and do further research if they want too. The Edit Text is the most important aspect of the app as if it wasn’t there then the user would not know what the fun facts are and what’s the actors name.
